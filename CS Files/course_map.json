This would typically include (but is not limited to): using a firewall, updating virus definitions, running security scans, selecting and maintaining passwords (and other entry systems), updating software, backing-up data and securing personal data.A key aspect of cyber hygiene is that it relates to an individual, rather than a group or an organisation.
